## 🔧 About Me

- 🎓 Final-year B.S. Computer Science student @ WGU  
- 🧠 Specializing in **C/C++**, **systems programming**, and **performance optimization**
- 🧵 Learning everything from **memory allocators** to **multithreading** to **networking**
- 🌌 Long-term goal: build real-time systems — whether for markets, machines, or space

## 🧪 Currently Building

Pushing toward mastery in low-level code, performance tuning, and systems design:

- ✅ **C Projects** – malloc, linked lists, file I/O, makefiles, gdb
- ✅ **RISC-V Sim + Interpreter** – exploring CPU architecture and instruction flow
- ✅ **Mini Shell + Allocator** – simulating core OS behavior in userland
- 🔜 **Multithreaded Order Book** – modern C++ concurrency, perf tuning
- 🔜 **Socket-Based Quote Server** – TCP/IP + low-latency systems
